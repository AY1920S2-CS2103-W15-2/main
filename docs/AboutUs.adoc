HireLah! is targeted to bring greater convenience to interviewers who can type quickly and prefer typing over mouse +
commands. Additionally, we included customised features in our desktop apps to help interviewers to manage interviews.

We are a team based in the http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg[School of Computing, National University of Singapore].
