== Introduction

HireLah! is an app that helps interviewers manage their interviewees, the attributes
you look out for in these interviewees, and the questions to ask during the interviews.
As a complete solution for interviewers, HireLah! also helps interviewers conduct interviews
on the app and identify the best interviewees.

== Quick Start
.  Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `HireLah.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your HireLah!.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open this user guide.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`add interviewee`* `John Doe`: adds an interviewee named John Doe to the application
* *`add question`* `How old are you?`: adds the question to the application
* *`exit`*: exits the app
.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of all the commands.

== Features

Generally, in an interview session (for example, an interview for a role in a company), there are 3 phases:

. Initialization phase (or preparation phase) - where the interviewer prepares his/her questions, manages
  candidates, receives their resumes, etc.
. Interview phase - where the interviewer actually conducts interviews, asking questions and
  making notes about each candidate
. Decision phase - after interviewing all candidates, the interviewer summarises his/her opinions, refers
  to the remarks he/she made of each interviewee and decides who to select

These 3 phases are clearly defined in HireLah!. What you can do in each phase is listed below.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `<angular brackets>` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add interviewee <full name>`, `<full name>` is a parameter which can be used as `add interviewee John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `<full name> [-aka <alias>]` can be used as `John Doe -aka Jo` or as `John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times, unless otherwise stated e.g. `[-a <attribute> -w <weight>]...` can be used as, `-a ambition -w 0.5`, `-a ambition -w 0.5 -a teamwork -w 0.1` etc.
====

=== Start Session

HireLah! takes care of this for you! By default, the first time you use HireLah!, the app will create a new folder
`/data` in the same directory as the app and save your session data there. To learn how to configure your interview
sessions (starting a fresh session, renaming your session, changing sessions) refer to <<FAQ>>.

=== Viewing help

*Command*

`help`

_Action:_ This user guide is opened as a PDF with your system's default PDF viewer.

=== Initialization Phase

==== Add and Delete Interviewees

HireLah! allows you to manage your list of candidates from within the app. You can add interviewees to the list
by giving their full name, and HireLah! automatically generates a unique ID for each candidate. To make things easier,
you can also specify an alias (a shorter name) to the interviewee, so you need not memorise their IDs or type out their
full names every time.

Whenever you see `<interviewee>`, it means that you can specify the interviewee you are referring to via any of his/her
unique identifiers - ID, full name or alias.

At any time you can delete any interviewees and edit their information.

[TIP]
Most names and aliases are accepted - even non-English names or names with funny punctuation and numbers (eg. Larry O'Brien the 3rd).
Your interviewees could come from anywhere after all. But do not give blanks or a name full of numbers (eg. 12345)!

*Commands*

....
add interviewee <full name> [-aka <alias>]
edit interviewee <interviewee> [-n <new full name>] [-aka <new alias>]
delete interviewee <interviewee>
....

*Execution Example*

....
> add interviewee Jane Doe -aka Doe
> edit interviewee Jane Doe -n Janice Doe
....

_Action:_ Interviewee Jane Doe with alias of Doe is first created and
then her name is changed to Janice Doe.

_Output:_

....
New interviewee added: Jane Doe

Successfully edited interviewee: Jane Doe
....

add metric <name> <attribute> <score> [<attribute> <score>...]
edit metric <name> <attribute> <score> [<attribute> <score>...]
