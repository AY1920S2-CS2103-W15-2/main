<p>My contribution to the project includes implementation of command to open an interview report, exporting an interview report
and command for navigation to a certain part of the interview report. I also implemented
the parser for most of the commands, with test coverage increase of 93% in class, 88% in method and 90% in line amount.
I was also involved in building the implementing the transcript of an interviewee.</p>

<h2 id="summary-of-contributions"><a class="link" href="#summary-of-contributions">Summary of Contributions</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement #1</strong>: Implemented <strong>export report</strong> command for exporting a particular interview report as a PDF.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: allows the user to export the report of a particular interviewee in a distributable and highly useful form, which is PDF.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: These features are very useful for the user as it allows them to retain a copy of the interview report outside
the application itself and it is exported in a distributable form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: This enhancement are very challenging and tedious. I used Apache PDF Box library and it does not have a lot of
support in text wrapping, positioning and pagination. Thus, I have to manually calculate and split sentences that are to be written in the PDF.
In addition, I need to manually split  paragraphs or sections that could not fit into the current page. Furthermore, for every line
that is written, I have to manually calculate the x and y coordinate of the starting point of this line.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement #2</strong>: Implemented <strong>open report</strong> command for opening a particular interview report.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: allows the user to open the report of a particular interviewee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: These features are useful for the user because it allows them to retrieve the interview report or result
after he/she has interviewed a particular interviewee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: This enhancement are totally new and was not part of the codebase.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement #3</strong>: Implemented <strong>navigation</strong> commands for navigating in an interview report.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: allows the user to perform navigate to a certain remark of an interview report according to time or
question number when the user is currently opening the report of a particular interviewee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: These features are useful for the user because it allows them to directly refer to a particular remark
that he/she is interested at, instead of scrolling up and down through the whole remarks of an interview report to go to
a particular time or answer to a question.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: This enhancement are totally new and was not part of the codebase. The implementation needs careful
consideration of the current interviewee, the bounds and input format given by the user.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement #4</strong>: Implemented the parser for <strong>create, update, and delete</strong> commands of attributes, interviewees, and questions</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: allows the user to perform an addition, deletion and edition of attributes, interviewees, and questions
of an interview session according to input message to the CLI</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: These features are a crucial part of the application as it allows the user to add properties to the interview session
in order to be able to start the interview.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: This enhancement are totally new and was not part of the codebase. The implementation too was challenging
as it required careful considerations on the different possible input received from the user and to handle incorrect and
correct input formats properly. I also added unit tests that covers most of the cases in these parser.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor enhancement #1</strong>: Implemented the building block of the interviewee transcript, which is the placeholder of all information
of a particular interview with an interviewee, including the remarks, the attributes and the score associated with it, as well as remarks
associated as the answer to a particular question.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>HireLah! can process numerous different inputs from the user, starting from adding an interviewee, adding a metric,
opening the report of an interviewee, etc. However, not all inputs are valid at any point of time. So, we need to make
sure that the right commands are accepted at the right phase. In addition, we also need to check that the input received
is also valid such that the Model component of our application is always in a valid state.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A feature in our application that supports this state validity is the Finalise feature, the feature used to
finalise the attributes and questions of an interview session, after the user has finished their CRUD operations to the
attributes and questions. After finalising, the user can no longer change the attributes and questions of this interview
session.</p>

<p>Validity of our application state is achieved through three ways, which includes:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Separation of the application into 3 different phases</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Command validation by the Parser and Model component</p>

<h5 id="separation-of-the-application-into-3-different-phases"><a class="link" href="#separation-of-the-application-into-3-different-phases">Separation of the application into 3 different phases</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are 3 different phases in our application, pre-session, normal, and interview phase. At any point of time, our
application is in one of these 3 states, and this information is stored inside the model, and it can be retrieved by calling
<code>model.getAppPhase()</code>. The reason behind the separation of the application into 3 different phases is because we need to prevent the user from
entering invalid commands at any point of time. For example, you cannot start interviewing person B while you are
interviewing person A. You need to end your interview with person A then you can interview person B.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the application had just opened, it will immediately enter into the <code>pre-session phase</code>, where the user are not allowed
to do anything except creating a new session or opening other previously-made sessions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the user had entered into a session, the application enter the <code>normal phase</code>. In this phase, the user can prompt the application
to execute all of the features in the application, except opening a new session and adding interview-related information
specific to an interviewee (e.g. adding a remark to person A).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the application is in the <code>normal phase</code> and the user decided to interview a particular interviewee, the application will
enter to the <code>interview phase</code>. During this phase, the user are only allowed to execute commands related to the interview process
of an interviewee, which includes adding remark, scoring the attribute and adding remarks as the answer to a particular question,
and toggling view between attributes, questions, or metrics.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The implementation of these 3 different phases is achieved through the presence of 3 different <code>parsers</code> in our application.
After retrieving the <code>current phase</code> of the application from the <code>Model</code>, the <code>Logic</code> component will then decide which <code>parser</code> of these 3
should be used to parse the input. Through this, we make sure that only appropriate and valid <code>commands</code> at a particular <code>phase</code>
are accepted at any point of time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given below are several examples of usage scenarios when the user prompts for some commands at a certain phase of the application:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Scenario 1. When the user provides a <code>command</code> which is not recognized by the <code>parser</code> that is associated with the
current <code>phase</code> of the application, the respective <code>parser</code> will throw a <code>ParseException</code>, informing the user that this
command is unknown. Suppose the app is currently at the <code>PreSession phase</code>, and the user tries to add a new interviewee,
<code>add interviewee Jane Doe</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="../images/SessionScenario1SequenceDiagram.png" alt="SessionScenario1SequenceDiagram">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Scenario 2 (Ideal Scenario). When the user provides a <code>command</code> which is recognized by the <code>parser</code> that is associated with the
current <code>phase</code> of the application, the respective <code>parser</code> will parser the <code>command</code> and execute the respective <code>CommandResult</code>
to the model. For an example, see <a href="#AddSequenceDiagram">[AddSequenceDiagram]</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="command-validation-by-the-parser-and-model-component"><a class="link" href="#command-validation-by-the-parser-and-model-component">Command Validation by the Parser and Model component</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By the separation of the application into 3 different phases, we had make sure that the input that is accepted at any particular
point if time are input that are appropriate at the current application <code>phase</code>. However, this does not guarantee that this
input will be valid according to the current state of the <code>Model</code>. For example, if the application is currently at the <code>normal phase</code>,
it will be able to accept the <code>command</code> to interview an interviewee. However, if this interviewee has been interviewed before,
doing an interview to the same person should not be allowed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assuming that the prompt inserted by the user is accepted at the <code>current phase</code> of the application, given below are
several examples of usage scenarios:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Scenario 1. When the user provides a <code>command</code> that is recognized by the <code>current phase</code> of the app but it is missing compulsory fields ,
the respective <code>parser</code> will check against it and throw <code>ParseException</code>, informing that the prompt is incomplete. For an example, see
<a href="#Scenario-1-Best-Interviewee-Feature">[Scenario-1-Best-Interviewee-Feature]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Scenario 2. When the user provides a complete and valid command that is recognized by the <code>current phase</code> of the application
but is not valid for the current state, the <code>Model</code> will check the command and throw a <code>CommandException</code>, informing the user
that this <code>command</code> is invalid for the current state. For an example, see <a href="#Scenario-2-Best-Interviewee-Feature">[Scenario-2-Best-Interviewee-Feature]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Scenario 3 (Ideal Scenario). When the user provides a complete and valid <code>command</code> that is recognized by the <code>current phase</code> of the
application and is valid for the current state. For an example, see <a href="#Scenario-Ideal-Best-Interviewee-Feature">[Scenario-Ideal-Best-Interviewee-Feature]</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="finalise-feature"><a class="link" href="#finalise-feature">Finalise Feature</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even with all of these implementations of <code>command</code> accepting according to the <code>current phase</code> and <code>command</code> checking in a
particular <code>phase</code>, there is another possibility of invalid state in our application, which happens through the modification
of the <code>interview session&#8217;s</code> <code>attributes</code> and <code>questions</code>. For example, a metric which takes in <code>attribute</code> <code>leadership</code> and <code>integrity</code>
has been created. Later, the user can possibly delete the <code>attribute</code> <code>leadership</code>. This makes the metric create not valid anymore.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thus, we need a feature that can indicate that the <code>interview session</code> has been <code>finalised</code>, which means that all CRUD operations
to the <code>attributes</code> and <code>questions</code> of this <code>interview session</code> is disallowed. CRUD operations to the <code>attributes</code> and <code>questions</code>
are originally accepted in the <code>normal phase</code> and if the CRUD operation is valid. However, if the application has entered the
<code>finalised</code> state, this disablement happens regardless of the validity of the phase and command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>finalised</code> state can be achieved through the <code>Finalise Command</code> when the user inputs the word <code>finalise</code>. Before the application
is <code>finalised</code> the user is not allowed to hold any interview with any interviewee, create any metric and find any best interviewees.
If the application has reached <code>finalised</code> state, the user are allowed to do so.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assuming that the user is currently on the <code>normal phase</code>, the phase which accepts CRUD operations for the <code>attributes</code>
and <code>questions</code>, and assuming that the given CRUD operation is valid (e.g. <code>delete attribute leadership</code> and
<code>attribute</code> <code>leadership</code> was there previously), given below are several examples of usage scenarios when the user prompts are related to Finalise Feature:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Scenario 1. If the application has not been finalised <code>finalised</code> and the user tries to interview an interviewee,
<code>interview Jane Doe</code>, the <code>Normal Parser</code> will parse the input and create an instance of <code>StartInterviewCommand</code>.
The <code>LogicManager</code> will try to execute this <code>StartInterviewCommand</code> toward the <code>model</code>, but because it has not been <code>finalised</code>,
it will throw a <code>CommandException</code> error.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 1 (current choice):</strong> Have <code>finalise</code> command and disallow CRUD operation to <code>attributes</code> and <code>questions</code></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: There will no be any invalid values or states, like an <code>attribute</code> score assigned to null.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Once the user decide to <code>finalise</code>, the user can no longer edit the <code>attributes</code> and <code>questions</code>. THe user will
need to create a new session if the user wants to.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2:</strong> Do not have a <code>finalise</code> command. User can perform CRUD operation to <code>attributes</code> and <code>questions</code> at any time,
including after interview has been done or some metrics have been created. Deleted <code>attributes</code> and <code>questions</code> will be removed
from any part of the application, and newly created <code>attributes</code> will have null score and newly created <code>questions</code>
will be assigned to no answers.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: More flexibility for the user if the user wants to change the <code>attributes</code> and <code>questions</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: The user might not be aware about the consequence of deleting one <code>attribute</code> or <code>question</code>, which might lead
to deletion of the all the <code>metrics</code> that uses this <code>attribute `, removal of all `remarks</code> associated as the answer of a <code>question</code>.
As new <code>attribute</code> are assigned to null score, these interviewees could not be compared with the others with regards to this feature
when the user is using the <code>best interviewee</code> feature.
User might need to assign the score value of this newly added <code>attribute</code> to every single <code>interviewees</code> that has been interviewed
before this addition, which is a tedious and unfriendly operation.</p>

from any part of the application, and newly created <code>attributes</code> will have a default score and newly created <code>questions</code>
